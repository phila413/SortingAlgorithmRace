# SortingAlgorithmRace
Made by: Philip Androwick

SortingAlgorithmRace uses several different sorting algorithms and measure how long it takes for the algorithms to sort.  The algorithms include bubble, insertion, selection, radix, merge, and collection sort.  The user inputs how many times the algorithms should resort (to get an average) and how large the arraylist that gets sorted should be.  The program then proceeds to run each sorting algorithm and then once finished, it outputs a table showing the total time and average time it took to sort each arraylist.  The repository also includes test files for bubble, insertion, and selection sorts.
